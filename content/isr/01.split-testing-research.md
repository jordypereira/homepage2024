# Figuring out a way to split traffic for AB Testing on Nuxt 3 hosted on Vercel and utilising ISR Caching.

## Background

Implementing Split testing is harder on our website because we heavily leverage ISR Caching to improve performance and reduce server infrastructure costs. Disabling ISR will decrease performance and has the possibility to 4x our infra costs.

### Why dont we just have a client rendered website? It would make it so much easier to implement AB Testing.

CSR serves an empty webpage, and then loads all data on the client. This provides no SEO and gives bad google performance scores. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ7nrsVQMh0

We want:

- Easily set up a feature test through a config file or tool
- Have it be unique per user and persist through user sessions
- Not mess with performance or increase server costs
- Be able to serve a whole different page
- Be able to swap out components or colors in the code

Dream implementation:

- Split testing configuration gets loaded in the Edge Middleware
- Edge Middleware reroutes traffic and sets a cookie
- ISR Cached page considers split test variant through a URL Query
- Client side reads variant cookie and displays correct information

## 1. Setup Feature test

### Client / Server side API Request

Traditional way, as third party tools recommend

### Edge Config

- Integrates with third party tools to load config in the edge

### Static file in code

- Read by Edge Middleware

## 2. Persist feature test through a cookie

### Edge Middleware

1. Add to config file:
    
    ```bash
    {
    	name: 'Test1' // Used for the cookie
    	url: '/adults/socks', // This page gets disabled for ISR
    	variants: ['no-plp-image'] // Variants
    	target-audience: 10 // Percentage of users to receive test
    }
    ```
    
2. Add to Edge Middleware and set a cookie
3. Disable ISR for specific AB Test page
4. Conditionally server render a component based on variant cookie

### Server Middleware

Risk: Cookie gets cached by ISR

## 3. Show a variant based on the cookie

### Disable ISR on Specific AB test page

<aside>
‚úÖ The first implementation has the option to disable ISR on a specific page. Depending on the test, it is not always needed to disable ISR.

</aside>

1. Cons: 
    1. Increases load time and server cost
2. Pros:
    1. No jank / flicker / CLS
    2. Easy to implement

### Enable Route Queries to be ISR Cached

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è The first implementation does not include this. This is worth investigating further in the future.

</aside>

1. Cons:
    1. Difficult to implement, cutting edge, not done before
2. Pros:
    1. Performance and cost unaffected

### Client side:

<aside>
üö´ The first implementation does not include this. I would not recommend this.

</aside>

1. Cons:
    1. CLS, Jank, Performance downgrade
    2. No longer SEO tracked
2. Pros:
    1. Easy to implement

### Island architecture:

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è The first implementation does not include this. This is worth investigating further in the future.

</aside>

1. Split website into components which are a mix of server rendered / cached and client.
2. Cons:
    1. Difficult and cutting edge to implement
3. Pros:
    1. More dynamic content and personalization for the customer

### Redirect traffic to a different page

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è The first implementation does not include this. This is worth investigating further in the future.

</aside>

1. Cons:
    1. Might show a different url to the user
    2. Will not work for every solution
    3. Hard to manage different pages
2. Pros:
    1. Works well with a CMS
    2. Retains ISR Caching

# 4. Track and Analyze results

1. Send events to GTM

## Considerations & Research
*Provided by Perplexity AI*

#### Client-Side Split Testing

**Pros:**

- Easy to implement with libraries or custom JavaScript.
- Flexible, allowing for rapid changes without server deployments.
- User segmentation and testing logic are handled in the browser.

**Cons:**

- Can cause flickers or delays in content rendering as the test logic executes.
- SEO might not reflect test variations as search engines typically index the default version.
- Relies on the client's browser performance, which can vary widely.

#### Server-Side Split Testing

**Pros:**

- Offers a seamless user experience with no flickering since the content is served directly from the server.
- Better for SEO as different variations can be indexed if set up correctly.
- Allows for more complex segmentation based on server-side data.

**Cons:**

- Requires server resources and might increase server load.
- More complex to implement, especially with caching strategies like ISR.
- Changes or iterations can require new deployments, slowing down the testing cycle.

#### Edge-Side Split Testing (Using Vercel Edge Functions)

**Pros:**

- Combines the benefits of client-side and server-side testing by executing test logic at the CDN edge, closer to the user.
- Minimizes latency and improves performance by leveraging global distribution.
- Reduces server load by offloading A/B test logic to the edge.

**Cons:**

- Can be complex to set up and requires understanding of edge computing.
- Limited by the capabilities and restrictions of the edge platform (e.g., Vercel Edge Functions).
- Debugging and testing can be more challenging due to the distributed nature of edge functions.

#### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) with Split Testing

Given your use of ISR in Nuxt3 and hosting on Vercel, integrating split testing requires careful consideration of caching and real-time content updates. ISR benefits from caching static content while still allowing for dynamic updates, but integrating split testing adds complexity, especially when trying to cache multiple variations of a page.

**Pros:**

- Efficiently serves static content while still allowing for dynamic updates, ideal for high-traffic sites.
- Reduces server load by serving cached content, with the option to regenerate pages on-demand or at intervals.

**Cons:**

- Complex setup to ensure that different test variations are correctly cached and served.
- May require custom logic to handle caching of different variations and invalidation.

In your case, considering the optimizations you've made to your infrastructure and the emphasis on performance and cost reduction, choosing the right split testing approach will depend on your specific needs for flexibility, user experience, and technical complexity. If you're looking to integrate split testing with minimal impact on performance and user experience, edge-side testing with Vercel Edge Functions might offer a good balance, provided the complexity and potential limitations are manageable within your project scope.
