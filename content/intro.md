## What are Field Experiments?

> Field experiments are experiments that take place in the real world, as opposed to the lab. They are a type of experimental design that allows researchers to test the effects of a treatment or intervention in a real-world setting. Field experiments are often used in social science research to study the effects of policies, programs, or interventions on human behavior.
